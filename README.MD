# Girens for Plex

Girens is a [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) media player client. You can watch and listen to your music, shows and movies with this GTK app.

## Why this app

There are more Plex clients that can be used on Linux. For example the Plex website and the [Plex media Player](https://www.plex.tv/apps-devices/#modal-devices-plex-media-player). Those Plex clients are lacking functions which I like to have. For example: a responsive layout (so you can use it on a small screen), function to download media items to the device and GTK+ is awesome.

## How to install

Setup [flatpak](https://www.flatpak.org/setup/) for your Linux distro. Download the Girens flatpak from the Gitlab pipeline. Then install the flatpak.

```bash
flatpak install nl.g4d.girens.flatpak
```
